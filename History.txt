=== 1.6.19 / 2009-02-28

* The previous release of FXRuby couldn't be built from source against
  Ruby 1.9.1 final due to a change in some of the file-related utility
	libraries (see "RubyForge Bug #23786":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=23786&amp;group_id=300&amp;atid=1223).
  This problem has been corrected.

* The previous release of FXRuby couldn't be built from source against
  Ruby versions 1.8.5 or earlier (see "RubyForge Bug #23967":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=23967&amp;group_id=300&amp;atid=1223).
  This problem has been corrected.

* A change in the return value for Ruby's <methodname>instance_variables</methodname> method broke
  some of the code related to message handling in FXRuby (see
  "RubyForge Bug #23787":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=23787&amp;group_id=300&amp;atid=1223).
  This problem has been corrected.

* The <methodname>addAccel</methodname> method for the <classname>FXAccelTable</classname> class
  now accepts lambda functions (or any other objects that respond to <methodname>call</methodname>). See
  the "API documentation":http://www.fxruby.org/doc/api/classes/Fox/FXAccelTable.html
  for <classname>FXAccelTable</classname> for examples of how this works.
