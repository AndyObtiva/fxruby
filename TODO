 * What about the existing bug lists and such?

 * Review all docs to purge references to SourceForge.

 * Modify FXGradientBar so that it just stores a reference to the gradients
   and doesn't own a copy (affects setGradients for example).

 * Need tests and/or examples for all the new widgets; see previous list, plus:

   - FXFoldingList
   - FXGradientBar
   - FXImageFrame
   - FXRealSpinner
   - FXRuler
   - FXScrollPane
   - FXSphered and FXSpheref
   - FXSpring
   - FXWizard
   - FXXBMIcon
   - FXXBMImage

 * Can we replace all of the aliases (in aliases.rb) with something
   based on method_missing? that automatically reroutes, for example,
   a call to SomeClass#tooltip=() to a call to SomeClass#setTooltip()?

 * Make FXDirItem#date (and anything else that deals with FXTime
   values) return a Ruby Time object instead.
